\frametitle{Introduction to the course}

>- Itâ€™s easy to feel totally overwhelmed and totally behind. Quantitative methods can seem like a huge list of rules that you just don't "get" - and have no hope of ever understanding. \textbf{This is not true.}

>- I still don't know things and get stuck. I will spend all day working on a problem and finish with the deflating feeling that I know that "shouldn't" have taken me all day.

>- But, many things take me 15 minutes today that took me 3 hours last year, or all day three years ago.

\frametitle{Vulnerability}

>- In grad school and beyond, there can be enormous pressure to appear like you understand everything. 

>- Quantitative methods are particularly threatening in this way and can trigger a lot of stereotype threat.

>- People may have also had access to very different opportunities around math/stats up to this point - or very negative experiences. 

>- \textbf{This course will be a space where it's very important to ask questions and be confused.}

\frametitle{Why should we understand quantitative methods (and coding)?}

>- \textbf{There is some inherent value.} Quantitative methods can provide empirical, falsifiable facts about the social world (but not what those facts mean!); for example, how did different groups vote in 2024, and was this different from how those groups voted in 2020?

>- \textbf{They will be used in your field.} You will have to understand and critique quantitative studies, even if they are outside the methodology you use in your own research.

>- \textbf{Non-academic careers.}

>- \textbf{Organizing/advocacy.}

---

\frametitle{Quantitative methods}

>- \textbf{Empiricism:} social theories imply empirical claims that are falsifiable.

>- Data doesn't speak for itself; it must be carefully interpreted, summarize, and analyzed.

---

\frametitle{How do we understand quantitative methods?}

>- \textbf{First principles $\longrightarrow$ Heuristics}

>- A critical skill is being able to know where your understanding is and where you want it to be.

>- It's very common to take a math/stats course that focuses a lot on first principles, say "why do I need to know this?", and give up on any level of understanding.
